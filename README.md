# SinglyLinkedList


Here I have implemented a Priority Queue using a Singly Linked List with a sentinel containing all appropriate and required functions.

The priority is set as the greatest number generated. For example, 56 has a greater priority than 23. Basically it should print the list of randomly generated numbers in descending order. 

To verify this 100 random integers are added to the queue. Then the first 20 numbers from the queue are printed.
